I am Sudip Panda, 23 years old. I like  AI/ML. I’d like to grow in AI/ML skills, practical project experience, and continuous learning of new technologies to stay updated and improve my problem-solving abilities.
My top skills are Python, Computer Vision, and NLP.
My no1 super power is becoming invincible.
I push my limits by taking on projects that feel slightly beyond my comfort zone. Learning new tools, tackling unfamiliar problems, and staying consistent even when it’s tough helps me grow both technically and personally.
A common misconception my coworkers have about me is that I’m always confident and unfazed, no matter the situation. The truth is, I do feel pressure and uncertainty at times, but I focus on staying composed and solution-oriented
